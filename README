For a simple build of libdwarf and dwarfdump2 
and the other tools for personal use:
    ./configure
    make
    cp dwarfdump2/dwarfdump <somewhere>
    Optionally: cp libdwarf/libdwarf.a <somewhere>

To also build a shared libdwarf in the process, do:
    ./configure --enable-shared
    make
    cp libdwarf/libdwarf.so <somewhere>
    cp dwarfdump2/dwarfdump <somewhere>


When ready to create a new distro,
do
./CPTOPUBLIC
./BLDLIBDWARF yyyymmdd
where that would be
	./BLDLIBDWARF 20061224
as an example.
