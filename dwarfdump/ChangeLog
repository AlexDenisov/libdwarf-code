2021-02-06 David Anderson
    * print_die.c: Refactoring for clarity and adding
      following DW_FORM_ref_sig8 links to find DW_AT_type
      targets. Also reporting line table file numbers
      as file names.
2021-01-31 David Anderson
    * dwarfdump.c: Ensures ERROR printf appear in the error count
      (A couple errors printed at the end were not counted.)
    * globals.h: Defining LoHiPc_s struct so we can calculate
      the high_pc from low_pc and offset-from-low-pc values.
      Simpler and better type checking than before.
    * print_die.c: Eliminate sets of 4 arguments,
      replace with LoHiPc pointer.
    * print_hipc_lopc_attr.c: Implement filling in
      LoHiPc_s and printing the calculated high_pc
      when appropriate.  Much easier to understand than
      the earlier use of bSawLowp etc. 
2021-01-29 David Anderson
   * tag_attr_ext.list: Added some DW_AT_GNU entries to
     DW_TAG_skeleton unit as common extensions.
2021-01-29 David Anderson
   * dwarfdump.c: Added commentary and slightly modified the
     producer names produced on CU DIE issues with the producer
     string.
   * glflags.c: Added commentary about the default producer name.
2021-01-28 David Anderson
   * print_die.c: Cleared out dead #if 0 and fixed indents.
   * compiler_info.c,getopttest.c,makename_test.c,
     print_hipc_lopc_attr.c,testesb.c: Cleared out dead code
     and fixed indents.
2021-01-28 David Anderson
   * compiler_info.c: Added comments about an unusual
     aspect of a couple arrays here. 
   * dwarfdump.c: Removed a stray back-quote from a comment.
   * print_die.c: Revised printing of dwarf expressions
     and ensured such appear in more places. Revised error
     detection of attributes requiring a string yet
     that do not have any sort of string FORM.
     Some #if 0 present to be removed shortly.
   * print_hipc_lopc_attr.c: A new #if 0 here is a non-functional
     improvment in printing high-pc. Not ready for prime time.
   * print_origloclist_codes.c: added DW_LLE_start_end case
     seen in test object.
2021-01-23 David Anderson
   * buildopscounttab.c,checkutil.c,command_options.c,common.c,
     dwarf_tsearch.h,dwarf_tsearchbal.c,dwarfdump-tt-table.h,dwarfdump.c,
     dwconf.c,dwgetopt.c,esb.c,esb.h,getopttest.c,glflags.h,globals.h,
     makename.c,naming.c,opscounttab.h,print_die.c,print_frames.c,
     print_gdbindex.c,print_macro.c,print_pubnames.c,print_ranges.c,
     print_reloc.c,sanitize.c,section_bitmaps.c,tag_attr.c,
     tag_common.c,tag_tree.c,testesb.c: Fixed indentation
     errors.

2021-01-23 David Anderson
   * print_die.c: Now checks all instances of DW_OP_bra
     and DW_OP_skip to be sure the target offset actually
     is a valid target in this expression block.
2021-01-22 David Anderson
   * glflags.h: Moved _dwarf_print_one_expr_op() out,
     it is now static in print_die.c
   * print_die.c: Now notices if DW_OP_skip or DW_OP_bra
     is in a set of operations and prefixes each operation
     with its block offset so its easy to understand the target
     offset.
