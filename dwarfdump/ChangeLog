2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Minor formatting changes.
      * print_die.c: Initialize some local varables at definition. Ensure that
        we do not get a FORM name in a name string (so a test
        works right).  And also ensure a FORM name does not get
        into a compiler-target setting.  Refine the formx_print_value()
        so it is more complete (like dwarfdump2). Ensure show_form_itself()
        uses the argument, not a global, for the show-form test.
      * naming.c:  Introduce a {} pair on an 'if' 
        to reduce the possibility of future
        errors.
      * print_pubnames.c: Add error details to match dwarfdump2.
      * print_ranges.c: If not printing, return immediately.
      * print_reloc.c: A test was coded with = where == was needed.
      * print_types.c: Move local variable definitions to the
        block they are used in.
2011-09-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Amplifying the -n help string.
      * print_abbrev.c: Adding the standard test of the section
        print option before printing the header line for the abbrevs section.
      * print_die.c: Added a {} pair to avoid eventual bug.
      * print_frames.c: Reformatted a comment for readability.
      * print_lines.c: Added a status test for consistency with the rest
        of the code.
      * print_reloc.c: One of the assign-and-test removal changes
        in the previous changes was wrong.
2011-09-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Removed duplicate usage_text strings.
      * print_reloc.c:  In case we don't have ELF64 headers,
        do the last-best-hope internal define in the right place
        so it actually helps. For some local variables, ensure
        they have values defined at the definition point.
        Switch some assign-and-test into two lines.
2011-09-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: Fixed typo in comment.
      * common.c: Use snprintf, not sprintf. Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Correct typo and move usage_text to
        a source position corresponding to that in dwarfdump.cc.
        Updated version string.
2011-09-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2011-09-15  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2011-09-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
2011-09-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * config.h, configure.in, dwconf.c, globals.h: Switch 
        compile dependency to configure time HAVE_STDAFX_H
        instead a system-dependent ifdef. 
      * configure: regenerate.
2011-09-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.c: Ensure each tsearch tree pointer is zeroed
        after emptying the tree.
      * addrmap.c: Now we actually free all the records, we were
        misusing tsearch a little bit.
2011-09-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.c: Now only check duplicate fdes if checking
        frames.
      * dwarfdump.conf: Updated to use address_size and includeabi.
      * dwconf.h, dwconf.c: Adding configure keywords address_size
        and includeabi.
2011-09-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * common.c,dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
2011-06-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c,common.c: Updated version string. 
      * dwarfdump.c: Refactor setting of do_print_dwarf 
        and do_check_dwarf into a function. Ensure that one of
        the refactored new functions is called in every case
        an option requires such call. Ensured indents ok.
      * print_lines.c (print_line_numbers_this_cu): When not checking 
        added a check to insure we don't try to call a 
        checking-related function.
2011-06-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * CODINGSTYLE: Added this new document.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string, fixed indentation.
      * print_lines.c: Two line table checks moved from
        decl_file to line_table sections of the summary report
        and both now show the possibly-wrong pc.
        Since one is not necessarily a bug, the wording of the
        message now has 'possibly' in it.
      * print_die.c: Reinitialize subprogram-relative pc high/low
        seen_PU_high_address
        whenever compilation unit changes, and use that field
        to avoid an erroneous  comparison (when checking for an error).
        Fix some indentation errors introduced recently.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Changed the missing-producer-attribute
        default string used in summary/error
        outputs to  "<CU-missing-DW_AT_producer>"
        so it is this string clearer.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_die.c: Now we strip off quotes dwarfdump
        added so -S match=main and the like work.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
      * print_die.c: Corrected handling of DW_AT_data_member_location.
        Corrected handling of 'class constant' function
        formxdata_print_value() so it does not leak memory.
2011-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
        Now -kd forces a summary error report, always.
        Even if no errors found or even checked-for.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
2011-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c,print_aranges.c,print_reloc.c: A few indents
        did not match the standard multiple-of-4-spaces. Corrected.
2011-06-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * checkutil.c (ProcessBucketGroup): Deleted unused
        local variables.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.1: Made the -k discussion more complete and accurate.
        Most option details are in the dwarfdump help/usage message, not
        in dwarfdump.1, to keep the man page small.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string. Made more variables static
        in recognition they are only touched in this file.  Added {} on
        some if statements to make the body clear. Parenthesized a
        complex test with && || to clarify intent.  Added sanity testing
        of the 'current compiler' count and its use.
      * globals.h: Added safe_strcpy() prototype as it is used by multiple
        source files so we need a visible prototype.
      * print_aranges.c: Add 'arange end' printing (it is a real DWARF
        record type, so should be printed). Add a test to avoid duplicated
        die printing and error-counting when it is not requested.
      * print_die.c: An = in an if corrected to ==.  Parenthesized a
        complex test with && || to clarify intent.  Deleted an unused
        local variable.
      * print_lines.c: Deleted unused local variables. Added {} for each
        struct in an array so the initialization gets done right.
      * tag_attr.c: Deleted an unused local variable.
      * tag_tree.c: Deleted an unused local variable.
2011-04-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Updated DWARF_VERSION string.
2011-01-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * print_frames.h print_static_vars.c Makefile.in
        print_static_funcs.c print_sections.c print_strings.c print_locs.c
        print_die.c print_reloc.c print_reloc.h print_lines.c print_pubnames.c

        tag_tree.list print_weaknames.c globals.h common.c print_frames.c
        print_aranges.c common.h:  New correctness tests and new
        formatting of various reports.
