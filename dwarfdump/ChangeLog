     * print_abbrevs.c: If an abbreviation number is a bit
       goofy, accomodate it so we do not write to
       memory we did not allocate.  It will
       be caught a bit later in the run as an invalid DIE 
       or abbreviation.
     * print_die.c: When we switch sections inside a DIE print
       save and restore current_section_id to get the best 
       reporting on errors/checks.

     * Makefile.in: Adding macrocheck.h, and .c.  Adding
       selftest of macrocheck.c.
     * dwarfdump.c: Now handles imported DWARF5 macros
       and adds support for -kw for macro section checking.
     * globals.h: Adding check_macros flag and macro_check_tree declaration
       and print_macros_5style_this_cu() declaration..
     * print_die.c: Now prints imported macros using
       print_macros_5style_this_cu().
     * print_macro.c: Now deals with imported macro units using
       macrocheck.c and .h.  Fixed bug for DW_MACRO_define/undef
       where we did improper string validity check.
