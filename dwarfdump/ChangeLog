     * common.h,dwconf.h,esb.h,globals.h,makename.h,naming.h,
       print_frames.h,print_reloc.h,print_sections.h,tag_common.h,uri.h:
       The address and URI for SGI is obsolete and there is no
       replacement so deleted some lines from the copyright
       statements. 
2015-01-30  David Anderson
     * common.c,dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
     * globals.h: Added format_sig8_string() to global functions.
     * print_debug_fission.c: Updated .debug_cu/tu_index hash signature
       code to match libdwarf (Dwarf_Sig8, not Dwarf_Unsigned).
       Allow for missing hash (?).
     * print_die.c: Use format_sig8_string().
2015-01-29  David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Two places used C99-only variable
       declaration. Moved declarations up to conform to C90.
2015-01-24  David Anderson
     * dwgetopt.c,dwgetopt.h: Using NetBSD getopt source with
       modifications to support :: for uniform behavior
       for all users. Not all getopt are the same. Named dwgetopt().
     * dwgetopttest.c: Does tests of dwgetopt() for conformance
       with dwarfdump requirements. See 'make selftest'.
     * Makefile.in: Now has selftest for dwgetopt and
       links dwgetopt.o into dwarfdump.
     * esb.c: Now prints PASS on success and counts errors.
     * dwarfdump.c: Now calls dwgetopt and includes dwgetopt.h
       Added a new global so we recognize where needed 
       not to do some checks when checking (
       for debugfission some things not sensible).
     * globals.h: Removed cu_offset (not needed) and added
       suppress_checking_on_dwp flags.
     * print_die.c:renamed cu_offset to be a static: dieprint_cu_offset
       Reset it when finished with a CU. (-k checks got into trouble
       when both .debug_info and .debug_types present).
2015-01-21  David Anderson
     * common.c, dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
     * print_die.c: For a DW_FORM_ref_sig8 type signature
       value, if not printing the actual FORM print
       <type signature> so the hex value makes sense.
       It is obviously not a .debug_info global offset.
       Now prints debug fission (dwp) information for
       each CU with such.
2015-01-18  David Anderson
     * common.c, dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
2015-01-15  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: dump_unique_errors_table() ifdef out
       of normal compiles, it is unused. Unused local variables
       removed.
       Update version string.
     * esb.c: Moved stdarg.h include just after stdio.h include
       for positioning consistency.
     * globals.h: Added stdarg.h include just after stdio.h
       include as we use va_list a lot and so stdarg.h
       is required.
     * print_debugfission.c: Remove two unused local variables.
     * print_frames.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     * tag_attr.c: #include stdarg.h. Add {} to array initializers
       output to avoid compiler warning.
     * tag_common.c: Move stdarg.h include to just after
       stdio.h for positioning consistency.
       Update version string.
     * tag_tree.c: Revised include order to start with
       globals.h and to not duplicate includes of stdio.h etc.
       Add {} to array initializers
       output to avoid compiler warning.
     * testesb.c: Add include of stdarg.h.
2015-01-12  David Anderson
     * tag_common.c: Add comments about va_start, va_end.
     * esb.c: Add comments about va_start, va_end.
       Add va_end in the selftest code.
     * common.c: Update version string.
     * dwarfdump.c: Update version string. Add va_end()
       and comments about va_end.
2015-01-08  David Anderson and Carlos Alberto Enciso
     * Makefile.in: add selftest: rule, which tests esb.c
     * dwarfdump.c: Add new options -O file=path, -kD -kG -ku kuf.
       New checking and reporting features intended to give a
       report on attribute and tag usage.
       Update version string.
     * common.c: Update version string.
     * esb.c, esb.h: Added new interface using stdarg.
       Added self-test feature.
     * dwarf_makename.c: new #pragma (not Linux/Unix related).
     * print_die.c: Implements collecting the new statistics
       dwarfdump reports.
     * print_lines.c: New statistics collected.
     * tag_attr.c: New checks for the tag/attr table correctness.
     * tag_attr.list: Fixes duplicated entries.
     * tag_attr.list_ext: Adds APPLE attribute DW_AT_APPLE_optimized
       that llvm emits.
     * tag_common.c: bad_line_input() now allows stdarg calls so
       its easier to emit good error messages.
     * tag_common.h: bad_line_input() arg list changed a little. Stdarg now.
     * tag_tree.c: New tag tree checking done. New statistics
       available.
     * tag_tree.list:  Adds DW_TAG_unspecified_type,
       DW_TAG_rvalue_reference_type,
       DW_TAG_restrict_type.
     * tag_tree_ext.list: Adds DW_TAG_GNU_template_template_parameter.
       Fixes duplication of entries.
2015-01-05  David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c:  Don't call dwarf_finish() if
       the dwarf-init call failed.
     * common.c,dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
2015-01-01  David Anderson
     *	A new year begins.
