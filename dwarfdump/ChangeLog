    * dwarfdump.c: Now argv[0] is checked before setting the program_name
      global variable.  If it contains /dwarfdump.O  that part of
      the string is shortened to /dwarfdump.
      Doing this removes a need for the regressiontests to use sed
      and shortens the regressiontests runtime on a one machine from
      77 minutes to 23 minutes.

    * common.c, dwarfdump.c, tag_attr.c, tag_tree.c:Update 
      version string.

    * sanitized.c: Now all non-ascii bytes are changed to %xx
      and a % input character is changed to %xx too
      iso-8859 and for html are now sanitized using URI
      %xx notation so the printf output looks sensible.
      These usually represent a corrupted string in an object file.

    * print_die.c: Added casts to call args match with the 
      function declaration.  So a fussy compiler will
      be less likely to complain.
    * sanitized.c: Added explicit initializers to global variables.
      Moved a static var to the function that uses it.

    * esb.c(esb_force_allocation): Code was wrong all this time.
      Fixed and corrected commentary. Updated copyright.

    * esb.c(esb_force_allocation): Add commentary about to clarify
      the purpose of the function.

    * dwarf_tsearchbal.c(dwarf_tsearch): In memory exhausted situation the
      function could leak a little bit of memory.
