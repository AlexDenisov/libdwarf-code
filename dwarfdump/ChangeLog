      dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,

    * print_lines.c: If missing a line number do not
      supply a meaningless -1, supply 0.
      If line table access gets an error, print the error
      and attempt to continue.
    * dwarfdump.c: We try to continue after major errors
      in more places. If any major errors were seen
      a final line of text is reported to standard-out.
