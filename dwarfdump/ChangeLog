      * dwarfdump.c: Changed the missing-producer-attribute
        default string used in summary/error
        outputs to  "<CU-missing-DW_AT_producer>"
        so it is this string clearer.

      * print_die.c: Now we strip off quotes dwarfdump
        added so -S match=main and the like work.
2011-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
      * print_die.c: Corrected handling of DW_AT_data_member_location.
        Corrected handling of 'class constant' function
        formxdata_print_value() so it does not leak memory.
2011-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string.
        Now -kd forces a summary error report, always.
        Even if no errors found or even checked-for.
      * common.c: Updated version string.

      * dwarfdump.c,print_aranges.c,print_reloc.c: A few indents
        did not match the standard multiple-of-4-spaces. Corrected.
2011-06-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * checkutil.c (ProcessBucketGroup): Deleted unused
        local variables.
      * common.c: Updated version string.
      * dwarfdump.1: Made the -k discussion more complete and accurate.
        Most option details are in the dwarfdump help/usage message, not
        in dwarfdump.1, to keep the man page small.
      * dwarfdump.c: Updated version string. Made more variables static
        in recognition they are only touched in this file.  Added {} on
        some if statements to make the body clear. Parenthesized a
        complex test with && || to clarify intent.  Added sanity testing
        of the 'current compiler' count and its use.
      * globals.h: Added safe_strcpy() prototype as it is used by multiple
        source files so we need a visible prototype.
      * print_aranges.c: Add 'arange end' printing (it is a real DWARF
        record type, so should be printed). Add a test to avoid duplicated
        die printing and error-counting when it is not requested.
      * print_die.c: An = in an if corrected to ==.  Parenthesized a
        complex test with && || to clarify intent.  Deleted an unused
        local variable.
      * print_lines.c: Deleted unused local variables. Added {} for each
        struct in an array so the initialization gets done right.
      * tag_attr.c: Deleted an unused local variable.
      * tag_tree.c: Deleted an unused local variable.
2011-04-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Updated DWARF_VERSION string.

        tag_tree.list print_weaknames.c globals.h common.c print_frames.c
        print_aranges.c common.h:  New correctness tests and new
        formatting of various reports.
