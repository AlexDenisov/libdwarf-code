      * dwconf.c: Changed table size to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * dwconf.h: Changed struct fields to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * esb.c: Checked for negative vfprintf return to avoid
        (hopefully impossible) error from crashing the program,
        and fix comparison warnings.
      * print_die.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_frames.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_reloc.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
