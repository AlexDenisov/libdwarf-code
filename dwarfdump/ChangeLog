      * print_die.c: Replaced use of makename (which did malloc)
        with use of struct esb_s, avoiding a serious memory leak.
        Completely removed static struct variables esb_base and
        esb_extra, ensuring die string print-data is not
        corrupted by recursive calls.
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.

      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Print DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly using
        the binary-compatibility version of Dwarf_Loc.

      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Print DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly.

      * dwconf.c: Changed table size to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * dwconf.h: Changed struct fields to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * esb.c: Checked for negative vfprintf return to avoid
        (hopefully impossible) error from crashing the program,
        and fix comparison warnings.
      * print_die.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_frames.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_reloc.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * tag_tree.c, tag_attr.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
