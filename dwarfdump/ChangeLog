2016-01-26  David Anderson
     * Makefile.in: Added helpertree.h, and .c.
     * dwarfdump.c: Added include helpertree.h
     * print_die.c: Now attempts (harder) to
       figure out if a constant is really signed or insigned
       when printing it. Fixes annoyance with printing attributes
       longer than 27 characters.
       Unifies a number of printf-style calls into functions, reducing
       the number of statically visible calls to sprintf.
       Attempts to remember whether some things are explicitly
       typed as signed or unsigned.
     * helpertree.h, helpertree.c: New. Simple use of tsearch
       to memo-ize signedness.
2016-01-20
     * configure.in: Added more compiler optiosn to --enable-wall
     * configure: Regenerated
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Fixed warnings.
     * dwarfdump.c: Fixed warnings.
     * dwconf.c: Fixed warnings.
     * dwconf.h: Fixed warnings.
     * esb.c: Fixed warnings.
     * globals.h: Fixed warnings.
     * print_debugfission.c: Fixed warnings.
     * print_die.c: Fixed warnings.
     * print_frames.c: Fixed warnings.
     * print_sections.c: Fixed warnings.
2016-01-20
     * macrocheck.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     * print_lines.c: Only print line context record
       if we do_print_dwarf is non-zero. The directory index
       was printing as 0 in the line_context record. Was a typo
       in the printf, now fixed.
2016-01-20
     * configure.in: Now --enable-wall adds -Wdeclaration-after-statement
       etc.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * dwarfdump.c: Now all functions have visible prototypes, no ().
     * dwconf.c: Now local func declared static.
     * dwgetopt.c: Added include dwgetopt.h. Unused function
       #if 0 so invisible.
     * globals.h: Now all functions have prototypes, no ().
     * macrocheck.c: Removed unused locals. Fixed a
       dwarf_twalk call to *tree (not just tree).
     * naming.c: Added include naming.h.
     * print_gdbindex.c: Made local function static.
     * tag_attr.c,tag_common.c: Made local function static.
2016-01-19  David Anderson
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Deleted the  unused function rotatex().
     * dwarfdump.c: Remove duplicate trailing ;
     * esb.c(esb_append): Straighten out the logic
       and avoid doing append if the to-be-appended
       string is empty.
     * globals.h Add ifdef __cplusplus for extern "C".
     * esb.h,naming.h: Idempotent #ifndef and __cplusplus extern "C" added.
     * print_frames.c: Ensure local var starts at zero.
       Move statement to below declarations.
     * print_lines.c: Ensure declarations before executable statements.
2016-01-19  David Anderson
     * print_frames.c: Fix trailing whitespace and indentation.
2016-01-19  David Anderson
     * print_die.c,tag_tree.c: Change statement ;; by removing
       second semicolon.
2016-01-17  David Anderson
     * common.c: Update version string
     * dwarfdump.c: Made reset_overall_CU_error_data() a global.
       We now try to show CU name etc on case there is an error
       reading frame data. Update version strin.
       Added DEBUG_FRAME DEBUG_FRAME_EH to the PRINT_CU_INFO() tests. 
       New function: load_CU_error_data().
     * print_frames.c: Now uses a local Dwarf_Error
       in a few places (CU names for frames) instead
       of the global 'err' so we do not get the errors
       mixed up.
       We now try to show CU name etc on case there is an error
       reading frame data.
2016-01-14  David Anderson
     * common.c: Update version string.
     * dwarfdump.c: Update version string. Include macrocheck.h.
       Delete one accidental blank line.
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Added comment about compiler warning.
     * dwarf_macrocheck.c: Added missing return statement.
       Removed trailing whitespace. Fixed broken qsort_compare()
     * macrocheck.h: Fixed trailing whitespace.  
     * print_abbrevs.c: Generalized an attribute count warning
       a bit (see GENERAL_MAX_ATTRIB_COUNT). Fixed the code
       handling the abbrev_array to be correct and a bit simpler.
       Added new abbreviations tests.
     * print_die.c: Include macrocheck.h. Fix trailing whitespace.
2016-01-12  David Anderson
     * common.c: Update version string.
     * dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
     * print_abbrevs.c: If an abbreviation number is a bit
       goofy, accomodate it so we do not write to
       memory we did not allocate.  It will
       be caught a bit later in the run as an invalid DIE 
       or abbreviation.
     * print_die.c: When we switch sections inside a DIE print
       save and restore current_section_id to get the best 
       reporting on errors/checks.
2016-01-12  David Anderson
     * common.c,dwarfdump.c: Update version string.
2016-01-12  David Anderson
     * Makefile.in: Adding macrocheck.h, and .c.  Adding
       selftest of macrocheck.c.
     * dwarfdump.c: Now handles imported DWARF5 macros
       and adds support for -kw for macro section checking.
     * globals.h: Adding check_macros flag and macro_check_tree declaration
       and print_macros_5style_this_cu() declaration..
     * print_die.c: Now prints imported macros using
       print_macros_5style_this_cu().
     * print_macro.c: Now deals with imported macro units using
       macrocheck.c and .h.  Fixed bug for DW_MACRO_define/undef
       where we did improper string validity check.
