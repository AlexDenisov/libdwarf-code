      * dwarfdump/addrmap.c: Implement HAVE_TDESTROY. 
        tdestroy() is GNU only. Now we allow tsearch without
        tdestroy even though that means leaking every tsearch
        map we build.  dwarfdump2 has no such leak.
      * dwarfdump/config.h.in: Add HAVE_TDESTROY.
      * dwarfdump/configure: Regenerate.
      * dwarfdump/configure.in: Test for tdestroy() function.
      * dwarfdump/print_frames.c: Zero out the map pointer.

      * print_die.c: Replaced use of makename (which did malloc)
        with use of struct esb_s, avoiding a serious memory leak.
        Completely removed static struct variables esb_base and
        esb_extra, ensuring die string print-data is not
        corrupted by recursive calls.
      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.

      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Print DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly using
        the binary-compatibility version of Dwarf_Loc.

      * dwarfdump.c, common.c: Update version string.
      * print_die.c: Print DW_OP_GNU_const_type properly.
2013-01-16  David Anderson
      * dwconf.c: Changed table size to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * dwconf.h: Changed struct fields to unsigned to eliminate
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * esb.c: Checked for negative vfprintf return to avoid
        (hopefully impossible) error from crashing the program,
        and fix comparison warnings.
      * print_die.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_frames.c: Changed counts to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * print_reloc.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
      * tag_tree.c, tag_attr.c: Changed table sizes to unsigned to fix
        signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
