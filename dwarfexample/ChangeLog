    * dwdebuglink.c: Refined the #includes so they worked
      with cmake.

    * Renamed getdebuglink.c to dwdebuglink.c
      and the example executable is now dwdebuglink.
    * Makefile.am,CMakeLists.txt: reference new name.
    * Makefile.in: regenerated.
2020-09-30:   David Anderson 
    * findfuncbypc.c: Removed a mistaken version
      of include string.h
    * getdebuglink.c: Now finds debuglink objects
      and if one is truly a separate debug it
      reports that.
2020-09-29:   David Anderson 
    * getdebuglink.c: Now follows paths and compares
      buildid of the executable vs the debug object.
2020-09-27:   David Anderson 
    * getdebuglink.c: Removed trailing whitespace, improved
      the new messages in previous commit (greater
      clarity in the reference).
    * findfuncbypc.c,simplereader.c: Removed trailing 
      whitespace.
2020-09-27:   David Anderson 
    * getdebuglink.c: Now looks to see if target files exist
      and reports which files were found.
2020-09-25:   David Anderson 
    * debuglink.base: New baseline test output
      reflecting corrected debuglink in libdwarf.
2020-09-18:   David Anderson 
    * CMakeLists.txt: Add getdebuglink to the
      examples built (source getdebuglink.c added
      November 2019).
2020-03-14:   David Anderson 
    * findfuncbypc.c: do not call dwarf_dealloc on a 
      name that should not be dealloc'd (it is a static
      string from a .debug section ).
    * simplereader.c (resetsrcfiles): Only do dealloc
      calls on non-null pointers. 
2020-01-16:   David Anderson 
    * simplereader.c: Remove trailing whitespace (1 place).
