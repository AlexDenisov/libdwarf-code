     * print_pubnames.cc(print_pubname_style_entry): Use of DieHolder and its
       destructor means a code dwarf_dealloc(...die...)  is improper. Removed....
       Failed to define and use a DieHolder instance properly: Fixed.
       Moved local DIEs to use a DieHolder and clarify variable lifetimes.
