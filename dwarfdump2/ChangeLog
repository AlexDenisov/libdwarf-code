     * dwarfdump.cc: Use the dwarfdump usage text. Add remove_quotes_pair()
       for consistency with dwarfdump.c and use it. Add check_lines to -kF . 
     * print_die.cc: the have_a_search_match() test was backwards. Fixed.
     * print_lines.cc: Add record_line_error() so errors can be seen
       in detail when appropriate.  Add some CHECK_COUNT calls when appropriate.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * print_die.cc: Fix the formx code by removing recently-added use of llabs().
       Fix consitency issue in error strings versus dwarfdump.  Set record_dwarf_error
       flag false for consistency with dwarfdump. Ensure PU_name does not get
       FORM info for DW_AT_MIPS_linkage_name.
     * dwarfdump.cc:  Fix endl use for clarity. Add an endl in DWARF_CHECK_ERROR3 for
       consistency.
2011-10-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Makefile.in: Making naming.cc like dwarfdump means altering
       Makefile.in to be more like the dwarfdump Makefile.in
     * checkutil.c: Moved functions here (from the .h) for ease
       in debugging. 
     * checkutil.h: Moved a couple function definitions to the .h.
       Changed the VODtype member to be a pointer so it can be cleared
       out trivially, and altered uses to match.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Free regex data.  Make format details match dwarfdump.
       Make do_all() match dwarfdump version. Ensure suppress_check_dwarf()
       called in one more place. Get the -ka settings right.  For checking,
       lower verbosity to one.
     * globals.h: Insert get_proc_name() prototoype.
     * naming.cc: Add error checking (but only when used in dwarfdump itself).
     * print_abbrevs.cc,print_aranges.cc: Get formatting to match dwarfdump.
     * print_die.cc: Get formatting to match dwarfdump (which involved more
       than just format changes, had to ensure that the CU and PU globals
       are set too, for the error reporting).  Added the LinkOnce testing too.
     * print_frames.cc: Made get_proc_name a global function.  Fixed up
       formatting to match dwarfdump.
     * print_lines.cc,print_pubnames.cc,print_strings.cc: Fixed up formatting 
       to match dwarfdump.
     * print_types.cc: Made more like the dwarfdump version.
2011-09-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * check_util.cc: New FindLinkOnceEntry function added for completeness.
     * check_util.h: Added omitted LinkOnce and VistedOffsetData functions
       so the code is complete.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Expanded on the explanation of the -n option. get_cu_name()
       now uses the DieHolder class as its first argument.
     * globals.h: Corrected omissions and misspellings of a couple globals,
       and correct a couple function interfaces to use DieHolder.
     * print_abbrevs.cc: Added abbreviation validation code and unified
       a couple places to print like dwarfdump. 
     * print_aranges.cc: Major changes to add checking and organize like the
       dwarfdump version is organized.
     * print_die.cc: Major changes to organize like the dwarfdump version and
       add lots of checking.
     * print_frames.cc: Modest changes to get the output and checking to
       match the dwarfdump version.
     * print_lines.cc: Fairly modest changes to get the output and checking to
       match the dwarfdump version.
     * print_locs.cc: Small changes to get the output to match the dwarfdump
       version.
     * print_pubnames.cc: Perhaps 20% changed, making the printed output
       work like the dwarfdump version.
     * print_aranges.c: If not printing (ie, if checking) just return.

2011-09-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * checkutil.cc: Added a blank line for readability.
     * dwarfdump.cc: Added the reloc_map bit field to the print_relocinfo call.
     * globals.h: Added the reloc_map bit field argument to the print_relocinfo
       declaration.
     * print_reloc.cc: Updated so it handles rel and rela and
       uses the same format and code organization as C dwarfdump. 
     * print_sections.cc: Changed one error print format so it matches
       C dwarfdump hex output form.
2011-09-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in,common.cc,common.h,dwarfdump.cc,globals.h,
        print_abbrevs.cc,print_aranges.cc,print_die.cc,print_frames.cc,
        print_lines.cc,print_locs.cc,print_macros.cc,print_pubnames.cc,
        print_ranges.cc,print_static_funcs.cc,print_static_vars.cc,
        print_strings.cc,print_weaknames.cc,tag_attr.cc,tag_tree.cc:
        Pulled in dwarfdump.cc related code and headers from dwarfdump
        so at the dwarfdump level we agree with the C dwarfdump code
        with its new options and compiler-checking features.
        The output is not yet what we want for -k options, 
        but this is a start.
