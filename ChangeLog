    commit 95edf93c288433a7d13bfe0d35d0481693e968ca

    Revised wording in error handling
    descriptions. When libdwarf is
    unable to report an error
    (the user provided no Dwarf_Error
    argument or errhandler function)
    the library prints a short message
    on stderr starting with the word 'libdwarf'
    and adding the error number it was unable
    to otherwise report.

    commit c7389aa2bfa3237d299bef199e00baa6a907ee39

    Removing the obsolete function declaration
    of dwarf_lineoff()
            modified:   libdwarf.h

    commit aa82e89aadefc51a4ec160cfe4045378ca5fd083

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_die.c
    Ensured every error case appropriate does
    dwarf_loc_head_c_dealloc() now to free resources
    as soon as possible.

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_frames.c
    Corrected spelling in an error message.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_die_deliv.c
    Added specificity to an error message.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loc.c
    Removed unused library-internal arguments.
    Added error checks to publicly visible functions
    to prevent user calls with null pointers
    from crashing libdwarf.
    Added magic numbers so the library can recognize
    garbage or stale pointers, and on free ensure
    the magic numbers are zeroed.
    Moved dwarf_loc_head_c_dealloc to dwarf_loclists.c
    to be near the other dealloc functions for locations
    lists.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loc.h
    Added magic number fields lc_magic, ld_magic, and
    ll_magic. Defined LOCLISTS_MAGIC.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loclists.c
    Added additional checks of incoming pointers to avoid
    crashing in case of user errors.
    Set and cleared the magic number fields as
    apprpropriate.
    Corrected the  dealloc/free code so it
    works properly in all cases.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_rnglists.c
    Deleted #if 0 debug printf lines two places.

2021-07-11:  David Anderson
    commit 1d9d4d16c5af77efbb619d7264873393af25564f

    Now all the arguments to public functions
    (and local ones) are all used appropriately.
    We use 'magic number' RNGLISTS_MAGIC
    so we can detect instances of using
    uninialized or stale rnglists pointers
    (the structs are not them selves visible
    to library callers)

    The declaration of dwarf_dealloc_rnglists_head()
    as dealloc functions are not supposed to return a value.
    Fixed.

    commit 144a6878c3d88f5db4f59c5f37db4f030ef61acb

    Neither libdwarf nor libdwarfp ever abort() now.

    In case there is no way to report to
    the caller what the error is (because
    the caller provided no means to report error
    messages) libdwarf prints a one-line
    message to stderr with the error number.
    For errors libdwarf and libdwarfp always
    return DW_DLV_ERROR.

    modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h
    These two are obsolete, their code is already gone
    from libdwarf.  dwarf_get_location_op_value_c() dwarf_highpc()

    dwarf_print_memory_stats()
    is really useless, the
    implementation is...an empty function.

    dwarf_get_abbrev_count()
    was never safe to use.
    And nobody actually needs to know the count of abbrevs
    in the entire .debug_abbrev section.

    commit f8826f61ca8ac8f3ba5528c0378eb814df621732

    The dwarf_init*() functions had an 'access'
    argument that has meant nothing.
    For a few hours it was defined as zero.
    (since the DW_DLC defines in libdwarf
    have been removed).
    Now that useless argument has
    been deleted entirely, reducing
    the number of arguments to those functions
    by one.

    Prevent -c (plain -c with no trailing letters)

    Ensure gf_use_old_dwarf_loclist false. That refers
    to obsolete API functions.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/command_options.c

    Delete the call to print_locs() as it

    commit 88bf7c78814c5a27392a62dab9ab3ce6a949ea01

    Now the DEBUG_INFO macros have the same value in
    glflags.h and pro_opaque.h. It's not essential,
    but looks better.

    In pro_opaque.h the values matter as they must match
    locations in a C array.
    So we changed the values (and in two cases names)
    in glflags.h to match.
    Each set of defines has a nearby comment mentioning
    the other set.

    commit 8de094bbf4007cff0d355ee7b786c29725a22fe5

    It was using sed and
      grep -o
    to extract the v_maj etc to make the
    complete version number,
    but -o is not a standard option.
    It did nothing on FreeBSD 12.

    Now there is is a python 3 script
    that does the entire job and we test
    the exit code so in case of failure
    it all stops and the python error message (to stderr)
    can be noticed easily.

    The API functions
      dwarf_elf_init
      dwarf_elf_init_b
    are removed. libdwarf does not use libelf
    now so these cannot be used.

    We stop building dwarf_original_elf_init.c

    The renamings of these sources in libdwarf (function and
    source) remove the  pro_ and substitute dwarf_
    These are not public functions, but they are called
    by public encode functions in libdwarf.h

    commit a6d8638c2089c42a6d00e375859b84feea309132

    dwarf_formudata() now returns any constant
    including non-negative signed constant values.
    Negative signed constant values must be accessed
    via dwarf_formsdata() as always.

            Now dwarf_formudata() returns any non-negative
            value regardless of form.  For actual negative
            values it is still up to callers to notice
            the returned error and call dwarf_formsdata().

    commit 0494e16bbd4f8a177785594779c10d2d6b7da44b

    Now libdwarf and libdwarfp build properly,
    a couple issues created earlier before
    split creating libdwarfp are now resolved
    so all build and make install and make dist ok
    when using configure.

    commit cbf7ec55ef1dfa1fab963c8dcc2ab59c8d79de5c

    Now we can build libdwarfp with dwarfgen
    successfully. A minor omission means it's not perfect.
    No cmake support for the separation of
    libdwarf from libdwarfp yet.

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/Makefile.am
            modified:   test/Makefile.am
    All the test code for make check etc, is moved
    to the test directory. Including the exe dSYM objects.
    This is much smaller than when in dwarfdump.
    Most of the checks run individually.
    The ones in runtestdd are hard to run without a script.
            renamed:    src/bin/dwarfdump/runtests.sh -> test/runtestdd.sh

    Not used. To be removed.
