    commit 1bffee59eb8de582fe360601a0a7d485a45fe066

    Twenty functions named
      dwarf_<something>
    were really internal-only functions. Not in the API.
    A few named decades ago, some created more recently.
    Now all such have a leading single underbar, so named
    _dwarf_<something> as a clear indication they
    are not part of the API.
    These became apparent comparing the API (libdwarf.h)
    to functions reported by coverage analysis (gcov/lcov).

    commit d46c1d2eeac7a66a699a892b3d3c50b6a6f135e1

    Now showing latest fixes to pkgconf
    references for libzstd.
            modified:   ChangeLog

2023-01-16:  David Anderson
    commit 31c3f298d4d11ec92fde6b5d176007ed20fe3755

    Changed zstd_deps to libzstd_dep and
    similarly for requirements_libdwarf_pc.
    To match the real pkgconf name of the library.
            modified:   meson.build

    Fixed the typo ref config_h.set11
    where config.h.set10 was meant. It means set to one or
    zero specifically (rather than a more
    general set). In meson documentation, look for
    config_data.set10

2023-01-16:  David Anderson
    commit f6d5dc20755cfcba300bac9eb27f86447c51a3df

    Corrected the requirements_libdwarf_pc
    to reference libzstd  because the
    pkgconf name is libzstd.pc
            modified:   configure.ac

    commit 7c83a9e7dd5a7238b16c7a38862a95fd3d39e2ba

    Corrected the check for libzstd, so HAVE_ZSTD
    and HAVE_ZSTD_H are now set in config.h

    commit bf923fc046fd868808489e5137b9f7bb0d982902

    To avoid warnings from a careful compiler we avoid
    redefining glflags when  building test__sanitized.c
    by using a -DTESTING in test/ builds
    to remove the reference to glflags
    from dd_sanitized.c.

    commit 76bebde070af2d49360a141053962949a9ea913a

    Each had a pointer subtraction and wanted
    a result of Dwarf_Unsigned so now using
    uintptr_t and Dwarf_Unsigned casts to
    assure compilers this is as intended.

    commit 9f0c8cd7ba0903b2fea66115afb8b16312ea4222

    Needed to add a fake _dwarf_error_string()
    implementation so this can compile (as we
    do not link with libdwarf itself).

    commit 5ca41b6751adf51856b839da3168a7baf2a7268c

    Now all these accept option --suppress-de-alloc-tree
    and ignore it so regressiontests can use
    these more easily.
