    * configure.ac. Version 20190223. With --disable-libelf
      most header checking is unnecessary and suppressed. 
      All the checks for int32 and the like removed 
      as we no longer use such types.

    * configure.ac: One can build forcing a non-elf build with
      --disable-libelf . If libelf is missing or will not compile
      the disable is automatic.  Now zlib is separated so
      -lz is added to the link line with or without libelf.
      Version is 20190217
    * configure.cmake: Now always defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
      so cmake builds continue to work as always.

    * configure.ac. Version 20190201. Now allows lack of
      elf.h libelf.h and if those and zlib.h missing
      then the link line shows neither -lelf nor -lz
      (libdwarf and dwarfdump will then support PE
      and mach-o objects but not elf)
