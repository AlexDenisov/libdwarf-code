    commit a9a8924d775c0389220a0fce7a762f4752fd974c

    Everywhere we dealloc (drop)
    a Dwarf_Error ensure we have a valid
    Dwarf_Error* to dereference for the
    dealloc.
    These situations arise when the calling
    program passes NULL as the Dwarf_Error*
    to a libdwarf function, which normally
    only happens in toy or small calling
    programs.

    This creates a useful libdwarf.pc with install.

    It also creates a useless extra libdwarf.pc

    commit 4f6376d8f4d57497e4083405d94f00651576b51a

    _dwarf_memcpy_swap_bytes is now simpler and accomodates
    all words 8 bytes or less long by swapping bytes.
      modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_memcpy_swap.c

    Now uses memcpy to write part of
    the line table header, not WRITE_UNALIGNED
    as WRITE_UNALIGNED is intended for integers
    requiring byte-swapping when the target object
    and the runnning libdwarfp do not have the
    same endianness. the write changed is a set of
    bytes, not an integer at all.

    commit 1bffee59eb8de582fe360601a0a7d485a45fe066

    Twenty functions named
      dwarf_<something>
    were really internal-only functions. Not in the API.
    A few named decades ago, some created more recently.
    Now all such have a leading single underbar, so named
    _dwarf_<something> as a clear indication they
    are not part of the API.
    These became apparent comparing the API (libdwarf.h)
    to functions reported by coverage analysis (gcov/lcov).

    uintptr_t and Dwarf_Unsigned casts to
    assure compilers this is as intended.

    commit 9f0c8cd7ba0903b2fea66115afb8b16312ea4222

    Needed to add a fake _dwarf_error_string()
    implementation so this can compile (as we
    do not link with libdwarf itself).

    commit 5ca41b6751adf51856b839da3168a7baf2a7268c

    Now all these accept option --suppress-de-alloc-tree
    and ignore it so regressiontests can use
    these more easily.
