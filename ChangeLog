    * CMakeLists.txt: Fixing a disastrous error removing
      creation of libdwarf.h from the build. The mistake
      was made in a commit 24 November 2020.
      Now ctest -R passes again, with or without libelf.

    * configure.ac: Now version 20210305.
    * configure: Regenerated.

    * scripts/ddbuild.sh: needed a -DSKIP_AF_CHECK
      to allow building a helper program that
      emits C source for dwarfdump.

    * configure.ac: Now version 20210214.
    * configure: Regenerated.

    * scripts/ddbuild.sh: Now also builds a table
      for initializing standard attr/form tables
      for checking attr/form combinations.

    * scripts/conddef.py,scripts/find_pdfpages.py,
      scripts/funcfinderhdr.py,scripts/funcfindermm.py,
      scripts/funcfindersrcs.py,scripts/haveinclude.py:
      All now are fairly close to following the Python
      PEP 8 style guide.`
