    Author: David Anderson <davea42@linuxmail.org>
    Date:   Tue Jan 4 10:21:22 2022 -0800

        Deleted dwarf_compress_integer_block()
        as it was meant to be removed earlier.
        No code in libdwarfp uses DW_DLV_NOCOUNT,
        DW_DLV_BADADDR or DW_DLV_BADOFFSET.
        None of this could have been useful in any case,
        it dealt with non-standard integer block compression.
