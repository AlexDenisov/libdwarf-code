The files here are for maintaining a list of bugs
fixed so html and xml can be posted to prevanders.net
and CVE (see cert.org) issues can reference a public
database.

This is intended mainly for bugs  that can result in
application crashes as such can represent a vulnerability
that can be exploited.
Bugs that result simply in errors in output (but no crash)
will typically not be mentioned.

It is a bit experimental.
It may be that the data will be changed radically
or moved elsewhere when that becomes appropriate.
