vulnerability: A specially crafted DWARF section
 results in a duplicate free() in libdwarf and
 the calling application will crash. 
product:  libdwarf
description:
 In file dwarf_elf_access.c:1071
 WRITE_UNALIGNED(dbg,target_section + offset,
     &outval,sizeof(outval),reloc_size);
 A crafted ELF file may lead to a large offset value, which
 bigger than the size of target_section heap chunk, then this
 WRITE_UNALIGNED() function will write the value of &outval
 out of the heap chunk.
 offset is a 64bit unsigned int value, so this is more than
 a heap overflow bug, but also a Out-of-Bound write bug.
 So WRITE_UNALIGNED() need more strictly checking to prevent
 this.

 data so the calling application can crash.

 Out of bound read bug in libdwarf git code.

 dwarf_dealloc() did not check the Dwarf_Ptr space argument
 before using it. This will lead to a out-of-bound read bug.
