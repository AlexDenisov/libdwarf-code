    * buildandreleasetest.sh. The cmake test H and G
      script sections were missing -DDO_TESTING=ON so ctest
      found nothing to run. Fixed.

    * conddef.py,find_pdfpages.py,funcfinderhdr.py,funcfindermm.py,
      funcfindersrcs.py,scripts/haveinclude.py: Reformatted

    * buildandreleasetest.sh: Adds cmake test H (C12)
      so ctest -R done with -DDWARF_WITH_LIBELF=OFF,
      the H test adds another libelf off test.

      for modified regressiontests configre.

    * buildandreleasetest.sh: Now uses temp files under
      /tmp/bart and if all passes removes that directory
      to clean up.

    * ddbuild.sh: Changes to sanitized.c meant a bit
      of changing for tag_tree etc.
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: A major revision. 
      Directory naming used in /tmp is now easier to 
      follow, and using a couple script functions
      eliminated many busywork lines.

    * run-all-tests.sh: Added echo statments to make
      it clearer were we are in the run.
2020-02-16 David Anderson
    * FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES: alter the startup message so
      anyone seeing it will understand it is the code (libdwarf etc)
      fix script.
2020-01-14 David Anderson
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: The script element that finds 
      the version in configure.ac
      now also allows for 202xmmdd versions, not just 201xmmdd
