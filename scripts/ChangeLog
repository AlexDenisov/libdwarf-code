     * buildandreleasetest.sh: Reference $HOME, not
       a hard coded home dir.

     * run-all-tests.sh: using a small function to check for failure
       reduces the file size by more than 40 lines and improves
       readability.

     * buildandreleasetest.sh:  The cmake test had misspellings
       in the cmake command options.
     * run-all-tests.sh: Renamed from run-bld-tests-readelfobj.sh
       and with small corrections. It now works in one environment!
2019-10-16 David Anderson
     * run-bld-tests-readelfobj.sh: New runs all the make check
       and the overall tests.
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: Added a ctest -R self
       to the test.
