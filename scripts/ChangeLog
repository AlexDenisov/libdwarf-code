    * buildandreleasetest.sh: A major revision. 
      Directory naming used in /tmp is now easier to 
      follow, and using a couple script functions
      eliminated many busywork lines.

    * run-all-tests.sh: Added echo statments to make
      it clearer were we are in the run.

    * FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES: alter the startup message so
      anyone seeing it will understand it is the code (libdwarf etc)
      fix script.

    * buildandreleasetest.sh: The script element that finds 
      the version in configure.ac
      now also allows for 202xmmdd versions, not just 201xmmdd
