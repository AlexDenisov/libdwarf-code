     * pro_error.c (_dwarf_p_error): The code attempting to deal with
       an unexpected error code was doing an inappropriate cast and
       an inappropriate (possibly out-of-bounds) reference to an array
       of strings.  Removed the cast and removed the questionable 
       array reference.
     * dwarf_frame.c: A couple lines were indented badly. Fixed the indentation.

     * everything:   Redid all indentations for
       consistency.  Updated copyrights.  Interfaces
       did not change, existing clients should not
       encounter difficulty.
