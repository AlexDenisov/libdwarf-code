      dwarf_form_class_names.c.
    * Makefile.in:Regenerated.

    * dwarf_form.c(dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed): For better
      readability a chain of if-statements is now a switch/case.

    * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Rev 1.53. Added a few words
      about relocating DW_OP_addr data: Such relocation
      generation only works right
      if the DW_OP_addr is the very first DW_OP
      in the expression.
    * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Rev 1.53. Regenerated.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.24. A font-marker
      was missing a \ so from page 252 the fonts
      were mixed up.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.24. Regenerated
