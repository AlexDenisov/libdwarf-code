    * Makefile.in: Add comments about what is built for build
      system (as opposed to host or target).
2018-03-24 David Anderson
    * checkexamples.c: This is just example code for
      libdwarf2.1.mm, not part of libdwarf. Now 
      checked by cc for errors and organized in the
      same order the examples appear in the .mm.
    * dwarf_errmsg_list.c: Added error code
      DW_DLE_LINE_HEADER_CORRUPT.
    * dwarf_line.c(_dwarf_set_line_table_regs_default_values):
      Add line-table header version number argument so the
      function works for DWARF5 (and earlier as well).
      Now uses dwarf_srclines_files_indexes() several places,
      simplifying the code.
    * dwarf_line.h: Adds new fields to Dwarf_Line_Context_s
      so that dwarf_srclines_files_indexes() logic is
      simple.
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.c: Passes version number
      to _dwarf_set_line_table_regs_default_values() so it
      works right for DWARF5 (and for earlier DWARF).
    * libdwarf.h.in: Added DW_DLE_LINE_HEADER_CORRUPT to
      error list. Added function dwarf_srclines_files_indexes().
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 2.61. Document the new function
      dwarf_srclines_files_indexes()
      and update all examples for formatting and correct C.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, Rev 2.61.
2018-03-22 David Anderson
    * dwarf_line.c, dwarf_print_lines.c: Index file
      numbers for all versions of DWARF (DWARF5
      indexes starting at 0).
2018-03-21 David Anderson
    * gennames.c: Updated version string.
2018-03-21 David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_access.c: Allow for relocations on .debug_str_offsets.
    * dwarf_errmsg_list.c: Clarified meaning of
      DW_DLE_DIE_ABBREV_LIST_NULL, added new errors
      DW_DLE_STR_OFFSETS_BASE_WRONG_FORM,
      DW_DLE_DATA16_OUTSIDE_SECTION,
      DW_DLE_LNCT_MD5_WRONG_FORM
    * dwarf_form.c: Added support for DWARF5 new FORMs.
    * dwarf_line.c: Added dwarf_srclines_files_data_b()
      so clients needing DWARF5 line table support can
      get the DW_LNCT_MD5 value if it is present.
    * dwarf_line.h: Added support for the DWARF5
      MD5 data.
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.c: Added 
      DW_LNCT_MD5 support.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Added _dwarf_extract_data16 so we do not
      have code duplication reading this data.
    * dwarf_print_lines.c: If MD5 present, we now print it.
    * dwarf_query.c: Correct handling of form for
      DW_AT_str_offsets_base.
    * dwarf_util.c: Add support for DWARF5 FORMs.
    * libdwarf.h.in: Define the values of the new
      DW_DLE codes mentioned above.
      Declare new function dwarf_srclines_files_data_b()
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document new function. Rev 2.61.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Generated Rev 2.61
2018-01-05 David Anderson
    * dwarf_macro5.c(_dwarf_get_macro_ops_count_internal):
      A test duplicated the preceding loop condition so
      the body of the test was dead code. Removed the
      dead code.
2018-01-29 David Anderson
    * dwarf_arange.c: Improve and comment checks for
      stepping off the end of arange data.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Make an error code 
      returned a bit more specific. 
      DW_DLA_DIE_BAD becomes DW_DLE_ABBREV_MISSING.
    * dwarf_errmsg_list.c: Added new error codes
      DW_DLE_ABBREV_MISSING DW_DLE_NO_TAG_FOR_DIE
      DW_DLE_LOWPC_WRONG_CLASS DW_DLE_HIGHPC_WRONG_FORM.
    * dwarf_form.c: Used DW_DLE_NO_TAG_FOR_DIE instead of
      DW_DLA_DIE_BAD to make an error return more specific.
    * dwarf_frame2.c: Add new checks for corrupted dwarf
      frame data.
    * dwarf_query.c: Added error check and changed
      DW_DLE_DIE_BAD to DW_DLE_ABBREV_MISSING in one place.
      Other DWARF corruption checks and error refinements added.
    * libdwarf.h.in: Added the defines for the new DW_DLE
      codes.
2018-01-29 David Anderson
    * gennames.c: Update version string.
