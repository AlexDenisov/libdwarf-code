     * dwarf_abbrev.c: Added comment, debugfission not supported
       in the non-cu-specific interface.
     * dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_base_types.h: Add DW_DLA_FISSION_PERCU support.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Added _dwarf_get_fission_addition_die()
       and  _dwarf_get_fission_addition() for debugfission support.
     * dwarf_error.c: Add DW_DLE_FISSION_INDEX_WRONG error string.
     * dwarf_form.c: Add debugfission support for str_offsets.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Load debugfission tables if such exist
       in an object.

     * dwarf_loc.c: Add debugfission support for .debug_loc.dwo
     * dwarf_macro.c: Add comment that debugfission not supported
       in the non-CU-specific interface.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Add structures for debugfission:
       Dwarf_Fission_Offsets_s,Dwarf_Fission_Per_CU_s,
       Dwarf_Fission_Section_Offset_s.
       declare the new functions in dwarf_die_deliv.c
     * dwarf_util.c: Remove a few lines of traling whitespace.
     * dwarf_uxu_index.c: Correct bogus formatting.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Add DW_DLE_FISSION_INDEX_WRONG .

     * dwarf_init_finish.c(_dwarf_setup): For all returns 
       in _dwarf_setup() free the sections malloc space.

     * cmplrs/dwarf_addr_finder.h: Fix a comment and remove a trailing
       whitespace.
     * dwarf.h: Blank line added accidentally.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Remove trailing whitespace. Fix indent.
     * dwarf_leb.c: Remove trailing whitespace. Fix indent.
     * dwarf_line.h: Fix macro backslash location, lining things up.
     * dwarf_util.c: Remove trailing whitespace.

     * 	dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_base_types.h, dwarf_elf_access.c,
        dwarf_error.c,dwarf_error.h,dwarf_form.c,dwarf_init_finish.c,
        dwarf_leb.c,dwarf_query.c,pro_section.c: Fixed indents and
        removed trailing whitespace.
2015-01-06  David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame.c( _dwarf_get_fde_info_for_a_pc_row): Cast
       the pointer returned from _dwarf_get_alloc(), somehow
       this cast was omitted.
     * dwarf_alloc.c(dwarf_dealloc): Ensure a NULL
       'space' pointer input is not touched before checking
       if it is set.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c(_dwarf_setup): For badly formed Elf
       ensure we do not use stale pointers.
2015-01-05  David Anderson
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c(dwarf_finish): If the Dwarf_Debug is
       not initialized do not use it.
2015-01-03  David Anderson
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Somehow dwarf_transform_to_disk_form()
       was not documented. Now it is.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated, version 1.38.
2015-01-03  David Anderson
     * dwarf_allo.c: Comment the allocation table base
       more carefully.
     * dwarf_base_types.h: Making DW_DLA defines more
       readable, more consistent with other instances.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Adding producer error codes.
       The producer library has some places error values
       are misidentified. Main effect: documentation.
     * dwarf_error.c:  Add the strings for the new error codes.

     *	A new year begins.
