     * dwarf_allo.c: Comment the allocation table base
       more carefully.
     * dwarf_base_types.h: Making DW_DLA defines more
       readable, more consistent with other instances.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Adding producer error codes.
       The producer library has some places error values
       are misidentified. Main effect: documentation.
     * dwarf_error.c:  Add the strings for the new error codes.
