     * dwarf_error.c: Fix a typo in an error string.
     * dwarf_query.c: Implement the new function 
       dwarf_get_verion_of_die().
     * libdwarf.h: Add prototype for dwarf_get_verion_of_die().
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: for dwarf_form_{s,u}data, mention
       the DW_FORM_data{4,8} class ambiguity.
       Document the new function dwarf_get_verion_of_die().
       Document version now 1.95.
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
2011-06-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * NEWS: Mention the non-elf documentation oversight.
     * dwarf_arange.c,dwarf_elf_access.c, dwarf_frame3.c,
       dwarf_funcs.c,dwarf_global.c,dwarf_init_finish.c,
       dwarf_line.c,dwarf_loc.c,dwarf_macro.c,dwarf_print_lines.c,
       dwarf_pubtypes.c,dwarf_query.c,dwarf_ranges.c,dwarf_string.c,
       dwarf_types.c,dwarf_vars.c, dwarf_weaks.c: Everything loading
       a section now checks the result for 'empty' and returns
       DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY explicitly.  This makes it easier to
       do nothing safely when there is no data.
2011-06-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_line.c (_dwarf_internal_srclines): Created new local functions
       to unify some repeated code in into function calls.  One of the
       earlier inline-repetitions was coded wrong.  Added {} to ensure clarity
       on the intended scope a couple places. Added initializers to
       a couple of local variables.
2011-06-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Added include "dwarf_harmless.h" so
       a prototype is visible here.
     * dwarf_form.c (dwarf_convert_to_global_offset,dwarf_global_formref):                   Deleted unused local variables.
     * dwarf_frame.c (dwarf_initialize_fde_table): Uses local instead
       of ignoring it (avoids compiler warning).
     * dwarf_frame2.c (_dwarf_get_fde_list_internal): Delete unused
       local variable.
     * dwarf_line.c (dwarf_srcfiles): Call uses variable expected
       signedness now, avoiding compiler warning.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Printf was missing %, gcc -Wall pointed
       out the mistake.
2011-04-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_error.c (_dwarf_p_error): The code attempting to deal with
       an unexpected error code was doing an inappropriate cast and
       an inappropriate (possibly out-of-bounds) reference to an array
       of strings.  Removed the cast and removed the questionable 
       array reference.
     * dwarf_frame.c: A couple lines were indented badly. Fixed the indentation.
     * pro_line.h: Now __x86_64 also gets MIN_INST_LENGTH 1
2011-03-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * everything:   Redid all indentations for
       consistency.  Updated copyrights.  Interfaces
       did not change, existing clients should not
       encounter difficulty.
2011-03-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h, dwarf_error.c: Added 
       DW_DLE_DEBUG_FRAME_POSSIBLE_ADDRESS_BOTCH.
2011-01-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf.h: Added some Apple attribute extensions.
2011-01-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Handles DW_FORM_exprloc now. With -vvv
       it now prints the dwarf version of the line table header.
     * dwarf_line.c:  Handles DW_FORM_exprloc now.
2011-01-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Added new function dwarf_get_die_address_size().
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented new function dwarf_get_die_address_size().
       Rev 1.91, 12 January 2011
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_form.c: Corrected handling of DW_FORM_exprloc.
     * dwarf_query.c: Implemented dwarf_get_die_address_size().
       Corected handling of DW_FORM_exprloc.
     * dwarf_util.c: Added handling of DW_FORM_exprloc and
       DW_FORM_flag_present.
