    * dwarf_find_sigref.c: Deleted two pointless
      blank lines.
    * libdwarf.h.in: The dwarf_find_die_given_sig8 prototype
      showed actual argument names. Now those names hidden
      in comments.
    * generates_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.
2021-02-06  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Adding dwarf_find_sigref.c which follows
      DW_FORM_ref_sig8 to report targets.
    * Makefile.am: Adding dwarf_find_sigref.c which follows
      DW_FORM_ref_sig8 to report targets.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
    * dwarf_abbrev.c: Deleted a blank line.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Additional minor refactoring for clarity
      and reuse.
    * dwarf_find_sigref.c: Now correctly finds the ref_sig8
      targets.  Does not yet reference any tied-file.
    * dwarf_line.c: Minor refactoring to focus on the 
      code flow, but also allowing (and reporting)
      when a compiler erroneously used DW_FORM_addr
      on DW_AT_stmt_list.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: refactored new CU context
      functions now availablt
      to dwarf_find_sigref.c.
    * libdwarf.h.in: New function dwarf_find_die_given_sig8()
      lets callers follow the references.
      Not yet documented in libdwarf2.1.mm.
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.
2021-02-04  David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Refactored the code creating
      CU_Context records, removing duplicated code to
      three new small functions: calculate_next_cu_context_offset(),
      create_a_new_cu_context_record_on_list() and
      load_die_containing_section(). Much easier to understand
      the flow now. 
    * dwarf_form.c: Clarified a comment.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Corrected a comment about cc_unit_type
      field.
    * dwarf_tied.c: Corrected commentary about reading CUs.

    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.25. Documents
      dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS_name().
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.25. Regenerated
2021-02-02  David Anderson
    * dwarf_form_class_names.c: new. Lets library clients
      print the name of any enum Dwarf_Form_Class variable
      by calling dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS name().
    * CMakeLists.txt,Makefile.am: Now builds
      dwarf_form_class_names.c.
    * Makefile.in:Regenerated.
    * libdwarf.h.in: Adds prototype for
      dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS name().
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.

    * dwarf_form.c(dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed): For better
      readability a chain of if-statements is now a switch/case.

      Fix indents.
2021-01-28  David Anderson
    * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Rev 1.53. Added a few words
      about relocating DW_OP_addr data: Such relocation
      generation only works right
      if the DW_OP_addr is the very first DW_OP
      in the expression.
    * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Rev 1.53. Regenerated.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.24. A font-marker
      was missing a \ so from page 252 the fonts
      were mixed up.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.24. Regenerated
