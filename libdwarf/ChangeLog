     *  dwarf_tsearch.h, dwarf_tsearchhash.c: New files implementing
        a hashed tree with tsearch() interfaces.
     *  Makefile.in: Add dwarf_tsearchhash.c to the build.
     *  dwarf_init_finish.c: Remove references to malloc_check and _dwarf_setup_debug()
        and include of "malloc_check.h" as those are no longer needed.
     *  dwarf_line.c: Removed a superfluous _dwarf_get_alloc().  The result of the call
        was never used.
     *  dwarf_opaque.h: Removed Dwarf_Alloc_Hdr_s references and simple malloc references.
        added de_alloc_tree as base of a hash database replacing most of dwarf_alloc.c.
     *  dwarf_query.c: Removed an unused local variable.
     *  dwarf_alloc.h,dwarf_alloc.c: Removed simple malloc support and all the 
        complicated code handling allocation record-keeping in favor of 
        much simpler code calling functions
        using a tsearch-like interface.

     *  dwarf_print_lines.c,dwarf_macro.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  dwarf_ranges.c, dwarf_sort_lines.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  dwarf_query.c, dwarf_pubtypes.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  dwarf_original_elf_init.c,dwarf_loc.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  gennames.c: Fix a printf so the generated dwarf_names.c
        does not have a trailing space.

     *	gennames.c: Added comment clarifying why error is set
        before the call to fgets, and fixing the declaration
        order to avoid c99-ism.
     *  dwarf_frame2.c: Use /* not // for comments in C.
