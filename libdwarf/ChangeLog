     * libdwarf.h.in, dwarf_error.c: New error numbers. 
       DW_DLE_LINE_STRP_OFFSET_BAD, DW_DLE_STRING_FORM_IMPROPER.
     * dwarf_form.c: Added suport for DW_FORM_line_strp into 
       dwarf_form_string().
2016-01-17  David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame2.c: Added additional checks for
       bad frame section. Looking for premature end of frame data.

     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented DWARF5 macro operations.
       Version 2.38
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated following a trivial
       clarification on cie production made a couple days ago.
2016-01-15  David Anderson
     * pro_frame.h, pro_frame.c: The code adding a CIE for output
       (dwarf_add_frame_cie())
       was simply assuming that the augmentation string passed in was
       in stable storage.  Now it uses strdup() to guarantee there
       no surprises.

     * dwarf_query.c(dwarf_die_offsets): 'res ==' corrected to 'res ='.
2016-01-12  David Anderson
     * dwarf_macro5.c: Fixed DW_MACRO_define/undef
       calls of  _dwarf_check_string_valid().
       Arranged to get the macro unit offset out
       when creating context.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Fixed declaration of dwarf_get_macro_context()
       to get the macro unit offset out of it
       so it can work properly in all contexts.
