     * dwarf_die_deliv.c(dwarf_get_real_section_name): 
       Uninitialized local char array
       could lead to unpredictable behavior, so now initialized
       with a NUL first byte so the array is a legal string.
       Coverity CID CID 190598.
     * ChangeLog: Renamed ChangeLog2018. New ChangeLog created.
     * Makefile.am: Added ChangeLog2018 to files in dist.
