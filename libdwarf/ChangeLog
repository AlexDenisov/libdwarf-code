     * dwarf_loc.c: Use cc_length_size, not cc_length to get
       the offset size. Nasty bug.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Change commentary to clarify the cc_length
       field content to hopefully avoid making that mistake again.

     * dwarf_loc.c: Added support for some DW_OP_GNU operators.
     * config.h.in, configure.in: Define and set HAVE_STRUCT_UNDERSCORE_ELF
       as FreeBSD names struct _Elf instead of struct Elf.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Initialize a local var at declaration, add const
       to array of strings type declaration.
     * dwarf_alloc.h: Change ah_structs_per_chunk to Dwarf_Sword
       to eliminate a compiler warning. 
     * dwarf_arange.c: Change a couple Dwarf_Unsigned to Dwarf_Signed
       to eliminate a compiler warning.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Change local to Dwarf_Unsigned to eliminate
       signed compare warning (and actually signed was wrong anyway!).
     * dwarf_error.c: Fix comparison to eliminate signed/unsigned
       compare warning.
     * dwarf_form.c: Index variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_frame.c: Local variables changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
     * dwarf_frame3.c: Local variables changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Local variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_leb.c: Local variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_line.c: Changed index variable to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Delete two unused local variables.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Delete two unused local variables.
     * dwarf_macro.c: Fixed comparisons
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Changed cc_abbrev_offset and de_fde_count
       to unsigned (which they should have been all along) to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Local variable changed to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * dwarf_util.c: Add include of pro_encode_nm.h to avoid
       a compiler warning. Changed index variable to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * libdwarf.h: Add ability to handle struct _Elf.
     * pro_alloc.c: Move an include of malloc.h as it is
       not needed if stdlib.h is present.
     * pro_forms.c: Changed index variable to unsigned to
       eliminate signed/unsigned comparison warning.
     * pro_util.h: Add specific allowance for FreeBSD include and
       relocation.
