    * dwarf_query.c(dwarf_dietype_offset): dwarf_dietype_offset()
      leaked a Dwarf_Attribute. The one line fix
      removes the leak.

    * gennames.c: Update version string.
2017-03-21 David Anderson
    * dwarf_form.c: Vulnerability DW201703-006
      and DW201703-001 fixed.
      Some types of form were not checked as being in bounds.
    * dwarf_leb.c: Vulnerability DW201703-002 fixed.
      A check for out of bounds was done after the
      relevant dereference. Fixed.
    * dwarf_loc.c: Vulnerability DW201703-005 fixed.
      _dwarf_read_loc_expr_op() was failing to check for
      a bounds violation.
    * dwarf_query.c: Vulnerability DW201703-006.
      A call to _dwarf_reference_outside_section()
      did not pass a sufficiently careful argument list,
      so a bounds violation was missed.

    * checkexamples.c: Updated dwarf_discr_list example
      with a cast to match function declaration.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Updated dwarf_discr_list example
      with a cast to match function declaration.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated. Version 2.53

2017-03-04 David Anderson
    * dwarf_loc2.c(_dwarf_get_locdesc_c): Renamed to _dwarf_get_locdesc_op_c
      and corrected the handling so offsets properly dealt with
      and so a final empty operator is synthesized properly into an
      end operator like DWARF5.
2017-01-30 David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c(_dwarf_make_CU_Context): Recent change
      in dwarf.h for DWARF5 package files required a small change
      here.
    * dwarf_xu_index.c(dwarf_get_xu_section_names): Recent change
      in dwarf.h for DWARF5 package files required a small change
      here and in dwp_secnames[].
    * dwarf.h: Now matches final DWARF5.
2017-01-23 David Anderson
    * config.h.in.cmake,configure,configure.cmake,configure.in,
      CMakeLists.txt,Makefile.in:
      Add checks for sys/elf_386.h sys/elf_amd64.h sys/elf_SPARC.h  so
      relocations noticed for Solaris.
      Better diagostic about not-building archive or shared library.
    * configure: Regenerated
    * dwarf_elf_access.c: Ifdef added for sys/elf_386.h,sys/elf_amd64.h,
      sys/elf_SPARC.h so Solaris relocations are found.
    * Makefile.in
2017-01-02 David Anderson
    * dwarf.h: DWARF5 added new DW_UT codes compared
      to earlier DWARF5 drafts.
