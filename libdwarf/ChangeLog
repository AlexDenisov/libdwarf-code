     * dwarf_loc.c: DW_OP_GNU_implicit_pointer requires a version stamp
       to work correctly.  Created a new function
       to allow clients to expicitly pass the version stamp.
       Most clients can continue to use the old interface.
     * libdwarf.h: Declaring new function dwarf_loclist_from_expr_b()
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documenting dwarf_loclist_from_expr_b()
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.

     * libdwarf.h: A pointer "*" was right next to
       a "/*" so a space introduced between them for clarity.
       Fixed comments on DW_DLC_SIZE_64 and DW_DLC_SIZE_32.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Two local variables were declared in the
       middle of code, accidentally creating C99 dependencies.
       Both trivially fixed with no change in logic.
