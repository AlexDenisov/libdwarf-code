     * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.
2019-01-09   David Anderson
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: One of the calls to
       dwarf_object_init_b() was checking the result code
       then doing a statment that will crash the caller unless
       the result code was DW_DLV_OK.
     * dwarf_generic_init.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_generic_init.c: After closing de_fd,
       set de_owns_fd FALSE as an extra guard.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Ensure the configure
       can set O_BINARY if necessary so open() will use it.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_generic_init.c,dwarf_machoread.c,
       dwarf_opaque.h,dwarf_peread.c: Simplified and unified
       the requirement that dwarf_finish() close the fd
       that dwarf_init_path() opened.

     * configure.ac: Version 20190104
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Now records that libdwarf owns
       its fd in the elf case and arranges to close it
       when the Dwarf_Debug is being closed.
       This is the case of dwarf_init_path().
       Hopefully will address Coverity CID 190599.
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Now that struct stat
       is not in use delete the sys/types.h and sys/stat.h
       includes as they are no longer needed.
     * dwarf_generic_init(dwarf_init_path): When libdwarf 
       owns the fd, call _dwarf_elf_record_owned_fd()
       to record that information.
       In the default case (not a known object type)
       we also now close the fd.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Add prototype for 
       _dwarf_elf_record_owned_fd, a new internal function
       so the fd can be closed by libdwarf only when 
       libdwarf owns it.
     * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.

2019-01-03   David Anderson
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Had a pointless call to stat()
       which was noticed by Coverity CID  190601
       as a possible race condition. Deleted the call.
     * dwarf_generic_init(dwarf_init_path):
       Serious bugs introduced yesterday.
       Coverity CID 190600.
       the fd is remembered in the Dwarf_Debug
       being created and will eventually be closed
       when the Dwarf_Debug is closed.
2019-01-02   David Anderson
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c(dwarf_get_real_section_name): 
       Uninitialized local char array
       could lead to unpredictable behavior, so now initialized
       with a NUL first byte so the array is a legal string.
       Coverity CID CID 190598.
     * ChangeLog: Renamed ChangeLog2018. New ChangeLog created.
     * Makefile.am: Added ChangeLog2018 to files in dist.
     * gennames.c(GenerateOneSet): Fixing Coverity CID 190603
       by removing an unused (unusable) value. 
     * dwarf_machoread.c.The include order
       is now libdwarfdefs.h then dwarf_base_types.h
     * dwarf_peread.c: The include order
       is now libdwarfdefs.h then dwarf_base_types.h
       Was leaking memory re-malloc into local var
       localdoas. Coverity CID 190602.
     * dwarf_generic_init.c(dwarf_init_path): 
       We clarify the use of fd and in case
       of failure ensure we close the fd if
       it is open (fd >= 0). 
     * dwarf_object_detector.c(dwarf_object_detector_path):
       Mistaken 'fix'
     * libdwarf_version.h: Updated version string.
